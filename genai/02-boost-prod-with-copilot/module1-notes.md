## Copilot Chat


This video lecture focuses on the key features of GitHub Copilot's inline chat and how to effectively use it for coding assistance.

Inline Chat Advantages
- Allows suggestions to appear directly in the code, eliminating the need to switch between chat and code.
- Offers prepopulated prompts to fix errors, saving time during coding.

Using Inline Chat
- Can be accessed via right-clicking the Copilot menu or using the keyboard shortcut (Command + I for Mac).
- Supports voice commands for users who prefer not to type.

Advanced Features
- Commands like /test generate unit tests quickly, while /explain provides explanations in a separate chat panel.
- The inline chat lacks back-and-forth interaction but remains a valuable tool for coding assistance.

## Command Prompts

In the video, several **GitHub Copilot commands** are introduced, which enhance your interaction with the tool. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key commands covered:

- **@workspace**: 
  - **Example**: `@workspace what's my current folder structure?`
  - Provides context about your workspace and folder structure.

- **@vscode**: 
  - **Example**: `@vscode what's the shortcut to open a file?`
  - Retrieves documentation-based shortcuts for Visual Studio Code.

- **@terminal**: 
  - **Example**: `@terminal how do I run a Python file?`
  - Offers terminal-related commands.

- **#editor**: 
  - Takes context from the active file in the editor.

- **#file**: 
  - Allows selection of a specific file from your project.

- **#selection**: 
  - Uses the currently selected text in the active editor.

- **/explain**: 
  - Explains the selected code or active file.

- **/fix**: 
  - Identifies and fixes issues in the active file.

- **/new**: 
  - Creates a new workspace based on your input.

- **/new Notebook**: 
  - Generates a new Jupyter notebook.

- **/test**: 
  - Creates test cases for the selected text or active file.
