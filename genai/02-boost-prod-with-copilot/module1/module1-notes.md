- **@vscode**: 
  - **Example**: `@vscode what's the shortcut to open a file?`
  - Retrieves documentation-based shortcuts for Visual Studio Code.

- **@terminal**: 
  - **Example**: `@terminal how do I run a Python file?`
  - Offers terminal-related commands.

- **#editor**: 
  - Takes context from the active file in the editor.

- **#file**: 
  - Allows selection of a specific file from your project.

- **#selection**: 
  - Uses the currently selected text in the active editor.

- **/explain**: 
  - Explains the selected code or active file.

- **/fix**: 
  - Identifies and fixes issues in the active file.

- **/new**: 
  - Creates a new workspace based on your input.

  - Clears the chat window.

These commands help streamline your coding process and improve productivity while using GitHub Copilot. Would you like to explore any specific command in more detail?

## Basic Code Suggestions

This content focuses on how to effectively use GitHub Copilot within a file editor to enhance coding efficiency.

Setting Up GitHub Copilot
- Create a new file and save it with a relevant name, as Copilot uses file names for context.
- Inputting clear and intentional names helps Copilot generate accurate code suggestions.

Using GitHub Copilot Features
- Experiment with different prompts to receive alternative suggestions from Copilot.
- Accept or modify suggestions based on your coding needs to streamline the development process.

Improving Coding Workflow
- Understand that Copilot is a tool to enhance your coding skills, not replace them.
- Encourage experimentation with Copilot to discover its full potential in your coding projects.

## Refine Your Prompt Crafting Skills

Craft 4S aligned prompts to get the best results from GitHub Copilot. The 4S framework includes:
- **Single**: Focus on a single, well-defined task
- **Specific**: Clear and explicit instructions
- **Short**: Concise and to the point
- **Surround**: Use descriptive names, keeping associated context open in the workspace

This course item focuses on enhancing your skills in crafting effective prompts for GitHub Copilot.

Understanding Prompt Engineering
- Prompt engineering involves creating clear instructions to improve the quality of suggestions from GitHub Copilot.
- The 4S framework is essential: Single (focus on one task), Specific (clear instructions), Short (concise), and Surround (provide context).

Applying the 4S Framework
- Examples demonstrate how to write prompts for different tasks, such as filtering even numbers or handling errors.
- Each prompt variation leads to different code outputs, emphasizing the importance of specificity in instructions.

Refining Your Prompt Crafting Skills
- The lesson encourages practicing the 4S aligned prompts to enhance Copilot's suggestions.
- Clear and intentional communication of goals is crucial for generating better coding assistance.

Here are the key takeaways from the lesson on crafting effective prompts for GitHub Copilot:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting clear and intentional instructions leads to better suggestions from Copilot.

- **4S Framework**:
  - **Single**: Focus on one well-defined task.
  - **Specific**: Provide clear and explicit instructions.
  - **Short**: Keep prompts concise and to the point.
  - **Surround**: Use descriptive names and maintain context.

- **Variability in Outputs**: Different prompts can yield varied code outputs, highlighting the importance of specificity.

- **Practice**: Regularly practice crafting 4S aligned prompts to improve the quality of suggestions from GitHub Copilot.

- **Clear Communication**: Communicating clear goals enhances the effectiveness of Copilot's assistance in coding tasks. 

These takeaways will help you effectively utilize GitHub Copilot in your software development projects.

This content focuses on understanding different learning techniques used in programming with GitHub Copilot.

Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Learning
- **Zero-shot learning**: This technique involves generating outputs based solely on the prompt without any examples provided.
- **One-shot learning**: In this method, one example of the expected output is given, which helps guide the generation of the response.
  
Few-shot Learning
- **Few-shot learning**: This approach uses multiple examples of the expected output to enhance the quality of suggestions generated by the model.
- The effectiveness of these techniques allows users to craft better prompts and improve the outcomes from GitHub Copilot.

Overall, practicing these learning techniques will help you utilize GitHub Copilot more effectively in your coding tasks.

## Analyze and Modify Copilot Suggestions
