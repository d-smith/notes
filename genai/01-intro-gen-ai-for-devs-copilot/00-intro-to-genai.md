## AI Basics

The text delves into foundational concepts of artificial intelligence, emphasizing machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks. Dev Ramesh explains that AI involves systems capable of learning, reasoning, and solving problems through abstract pattern recognition. Machine learning enables systems to improve performance from data, while neural networks form specific algorithms within machine learning, optimized for tasks like image processing (CNNs) and sequential data handling (RNNs).

Deep learning uses layered neural networks for tasks requiring large datasets, including generative AI capabilities. Transformers, such as those powering GPT-4, are highlighted for overcoming limitations of traditional RNNs. The text emphasizes choosing appropriate AI technologies for specific problems and encourages further exploration of AI applications and ethical implications in projects.

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are both subsets of artificial intelligence, but they differ in scope, complexity, and approach. Here's a breakdown:

Definition and Scope:

Machine Learning: A broad field within AI focused on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

Deep Learning: A specialized branch of ML that relies on artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to process vast amounts of data and solve more complex problems.

Algorithms and Models:

ML: Includes a variety of algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and k-means clustering. These are typically simpler and work well on structured, smaller datasets.

DL: Uses deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data like text or speech.

Data Requirements:

ML: Performs effectively with relatively small datasets, as traditional ML models are less complex.

DL: Requires vast amounts of labeled data to train its multi-layered networks, which help in recognizing intricate patterns.

Feature Engineering:

ML: Relies heavily on manual feature engineering, where humans select the most relevant features of data for the algorithm.

DL: Automatically extracts features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Performance on Complex Tasks:

ML: Best suited for moderately complex tasks (e.g., spam detection, price predictions).

DL: Excels at handling extremely complex tasks like image recognition, language translation, and generative applications.

Computational Requirements:

ML: Typically less demanding in terms of computational resources.

DL: Requires significant computational power and GPUs/TPUs due to the complexity of deep neural networks.
