# Notes from Exploring the Apache Flink API for Processing Streaming Data

Flink APIs - High to Low Abstraction

* SQL
    *  Highest level of abstraction
    * Similar to Table API in terms of semantics and expressiveness
* Table API
    * Operate on data organized as tables
    * Declarative DSL centered around tables
* DataStream/DataSet API
    * Core APIs for bounded and unbounded data
    * Transformation, joins, aggregation, windowing
* Stateful Stream Processing
    * Timely processing
    * Stateful processing
    * Fault tolerant state
