Some history

* 2008 - Bitcoin
* 2013 - Ethereum - expansion of decentralized peer to peer networks to handle more uses cases via smart contract functionality

Challenges with public, general purposes blockchains:

 * Low flexibility for devs
 * Speed - transactions speed
 * Throughput
 * Scalability
 * State finality -  Finality describes whether and when committed blocks with transactions can no longer be reverted/revoked. It is important to differentiate between probabilistic and absolute finality.
 * Sovereignty

The Interchain

> The interchain is a network of independent blockchains, which are:
>
> * All powered by consensus algorithms with Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT).
> * All connected through the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC), which enables value transfers, token transfers, and other communication between chains, all without the need to involve exchanges or make compromises regarding the sovereignty of each chain.
>
> The interchain is also a blockchain ecosystem complete with protocols, SDK, tokens, wallets, applications, repositories, services, and tools.
