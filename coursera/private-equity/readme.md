## Week 1

The definition of Private Equity (PE) is based on two aspects, each related to the
two man characteristics of the PE relation:

- PE is a source of financing: It is an alternative to other sources of
liquidity, (such as a loan or an initial public offering (IPO)) for the
company receiving the financing.
- PE is an investment made by a financial institution: Private Equity
Investor (PEI) in the equity of a non-listed company (i.e. not a public
company).

### Consequences of Financing

As a consequence, the relationship between the venture-backed company and the
PEI is based on some relevant issues:

- A company needing money for a certain and clearly identified reason;
- The company collects money with the issuance of equity on the private market,
the company does not pay any interest expenses to the PEI;
- The newly issued shares will be bought by the PEI;
- The professional investor will not only become a shareholder but will contribute
to the management of the company. The smaller the company is, the larger the
contribution of the PEI in the business management will be;
- The professional investor will create profit only through the generation of capital
gain, i.e. exiting from the investment by selling shares to someone else on the
market. 

### Public vs Private Equity

Differences in liquidity, pricing, and monitoring.

Public:

- Liquidity: Shares are traded on a public market, so they can be bought and sold
easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the market, and it is
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the market, and the company is
required to disclose information to the public.

Private:

- Liquidity: Shares are not traded on a public market, so they cannot be bought
and sold easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the PEI, and it is not
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the PEI, and the company is not
required to disclose information to the public.

### Why Would a Company Use Private Equity?

- Certifications: The PEI is a professional investor, and the investment is a
certification of the company's value.
- Networking: The PEI can provide the company with a network of contacts, suppliers,
and customers.
- Knowledge and Skills: The PEI can provide the company with knowledge and skills
that the company does not have. This can be soft knowledge, such as management
skills, or hard knowledge, such as technical skills or domain expertise.
- Financial Resources: The PEI can provide the company with financial resources
that the company does not have. This can be money, but it can also be financial
engineering skills, such as the ability to structure a deal or to raise debt, or
establishing credit worthiness.
