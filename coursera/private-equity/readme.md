## Week 1

The definition of Private Equity (PE) is based on two aspects, each related to the
two man characteristics of the PE relation:

- PE is a source of financing: It is an alternative to other sources of
liquidity, (such as a loan or an initial public offering (IPO)) for the
company receiving the financing.
- PE is an investment made by a financial institution: Private Equity
Investor (PEI) in the equity of a non-listed company (i.e. not a public
company).

### Consequences of Financing

As a consequence, the relationship between the venture-backed company and the
PEI is based on some relevant issues:

- A company needing money for a certain and clearly identified reason;
- The company collects money with the issuance of equity on the private market,
the company does not pay any interest expenses to the PEI;
- The newly issued shares will be bought by the PEI;
- The professional investor will not only become a shareholder but will contribute
to the management of the company. The smaller the company is, the larger the
contribution of the PEI in the business management will be;
- The professional investor will create profit only through the generation of capital
gain, i.e. exiting from the investment by selling shares to someone else on the
market. 

### Public vs Private Equity

Differences in liquidity, pricing, and monitoring.

Public:

- Liquidity: Shares are traded on a public market, so they can be bought and sold
easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the market, and it is
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the market, and the company is
required to disclose information to the public.

Private:

- Liquidity: Shares are not traded on a public market, so they cannot be bought
and sold easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the PEI, and it is not
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the PEI, and the company is not
required to disclose information to the public.
