## Week 1

The definition of Private Equity (PE) is based on two aspects, each related to the
two man characteristics of the PE relation:

- PE is a source of financing: It is an alternative to other sources of
liquidity, (such as a loan or an initial public offering (IPO)) for the
company receiving the financing.
- PE is an investment made by a financial institution: Private Equity
Investor (PEI) in the equity of a non-listed company (i.e. not a public
company).

### Consequences of Financing

As a consequence, the relationship between the venture-backed company and the
PEI is based on some relevant issues:

- A company needing money for a certain and clearly identified reason;
- The company collects money with the issuance of equity on the private market,
the company does not pay any interest expenses to the PEI;
- The newly issued shares will be bought by the PEI;
- The professional investor will not only become a shareholder but will contribute
to the management of the company. The smaller the company is, the larger the
contribution of the PEI in the business management will be;
- The professional investor will create profit only through the generation of capital
gain, i.e. exiting from the investment by selling shares to someone else on the
market. 

### Public vs Private Equity

Differences in liquidity, pricing, and monitoring.

Public:

- Liquidity: Shares are traded on a public market, so they can be bought and sold
easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the market, and it is
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the market, and the company is
required to disclose information to the public.

Private:

- Liquidity: Shares are not traded on a public market, so they cannot be bought
and sold easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the PEI, and it is not
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the PEI, and the company is not
required to disclose information to the public.

### Why Would a Company Use Private Equity?

- Certifications: The PEI is a professional investor, and the investment is a
certification of the company's value.
- Networking: The PEI can provide the company with a network of contacts, suppliers,
and customers.
- Knowledge and Skills: The PEI can provide the company with knowledge and skills
that the company does not have. This can be soft knowledge, such as management
skills, or hard knowledge, such as technical skills or domain expertise.
- Financial Resources: The PEI can provide the company with financial resources
that the company does not have. This can be money, but it can also be financial
engineering skills, such as the ability to structure a deal or to raise debt, or
establishing credit worthiness.

Financial needs vary across the life cycle of a company.

Expansion financing
Replacement Financing
Vulture Financing

6 different deals, markets, different risk/reward profiles

How much ownership, how much hands on?

## Seed, Start-Up, Early Stage Financing

Venture capital

Seed financing - most complex and risky

* Financing of an R&D project to generate a patent that can become a product
* Sectors - biomedical, chemical, IT, pharma
* Very high risk

100/10/1 rules - screen 100 projects, invest in 10, 1 will be a success

Startup financing

* Financing of a company that has a product and a business model
* Money needed to start the activity
* High risk - making a bet on the business plan
* Investor must negotiate the terms to protect the investment, e.g. a put option to sell shares back to the entrepreneur

Early Stage

* The day after financing
* May need to finance a gap in financing based up the uptake of the business
* Investor may need to be hands on -  help the entrepreneur write the business plan again, to analyze the reason of this gap, and to launch the activity of the company again


 ## Expansion Financing

 Expansion financing is the process of financing the growth of the company.

 Growth

 * Can be organic or inorganic
    * Organic/Internal Growth - the company grows by itself
        * Invest in new assets
        * Enhance the working capital
    * Inorganic/External Growth - the company grows by acquiring other companies
        * Enter new markets
        * Change business area

Job of PE Investor

* Organic - give money to the company
* Inorganic - give money, but also act as advisor and consultant to the company

Steps of M&A

* Screen and scout the market
* Support negotiation with the potential target
* Give money to the company to fund the acquisition
    * Give money in exchange for shares
    * PEI creates a special purpose vehicle SPV, PEI and company fund the shell, SPV uses the banking system to fund the acquisition
* Provide legal and taxation support


SPV option avoids saddling the new company with debt

## Replacement Financing

Financing of a mature company that needs to change its capital structure

Three different deals

* Leveraged Buyout (LBO)
    * Identify potential target to buy 100%
    * PEI creates an SPV
    * Fund the SPV with equity and debt
    * SPV buys the target, SPV owns the company, and since the PEI owns the SPV, the PEI owns the company
    * PEI can then easily seel the company as they own it 100%
* PIPE - Private investment in public equity
    * Buy a minority stake in a public company
    * Gamble is the stake is enough to decide who will be the owner of the company
    * Use the stake to negotiate the price
* Corporate Governance Deals
    * This is prompted by a company needing to reorganize its corporate governance, for example succession in a family business
    * PEI buys shares from an existing shareholder to become an insider in the company
    * PEI works as an insider to restructure the governance of the company
    * PEI sells the shares to another shareholder


## Vulture Financing

Finance a company in crisis or decline

Two different deals

* Restructuring Financing
    * Company in crisis but still alive
    * Needs financing to pay suppliers, invest to relaunch
    * Needs strategic support
    * PEI provides money and strategic support
    * Very risky, PEI will want to be the majority shareholder

* Distressed Financing
    * Financing of a defaulted company, dead company
    * PEI buys the assets of the defauled company - brand name, patents, equipment, etc
        * PEI may create a new company, and will use the assets to start a new business
        * PEI may sell the assets to another company
    * Difficult as the sale is negotiated by the court
