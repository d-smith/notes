## Week 1

The definition of Private Equity (PE) is based on two aspects, each related to the
two man characteristics of the PE relation:

- PE is a source of financing: It is an alternative to other sources of
liquidity, (such as a loan or an initial public offering (IPO)) for the
company receiving the financing.
- PE is an investment made by a financial institution: Private Equity
Investor (PEI) in the equity of a non-listed company (i.e. not a public
company).

### Consequences of Financing

As a consequence, the relationship between the venture-backed company and the
PEI is based on some relevant issues:

- A company needing money for a certain and clearly identified reason;
- The company collects money with the issuance of equity on the private market,
the company does not pay any interest expenses to the PEI;
- The newly issued shares will be bought by the PEI;
- The professional investor will not only become a shareholder but will contribute
to the management of the company. The smaller the company is, the larger the
contribution of the PEI in the business management will be;
- The professional investor will create profit only through the generation of capital
gain, i.e. exiting from the investment by selling shares to someone else on the
market. 

### Public vs Private Equity

Differences in liquidity, pricing, and monitoring.

Public:

- Liquidity: Shares are traded on a public market, so they can be bought and sold
easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the market, and it is
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the market, and the company is
required to disclose information to the public.

Private:

- Liquidity: Shares are not traded on a public market, so they cannot be bought
and sold easily.
- Pricing: The price of the shares is determined by the PEI, and it is not
continuously updated.
- Monitoring: The company is monitored by the PEI, and the company is not
required to disclose information to the public.

### Why Would a Company Use Private Equity?

- Certifications: The PEI is a professional investor, and the investment is a
certification of the company's value.
- Networking: The PEI can provide the company with a network of contacts, suppliers,
and customers.
- Knowledge and Skills: The PEI can provide the company with knowledge and skills
that the company does not have. This can be soft knowledge, such as management
skills, or hard knowledge, such as technical skills or domain expertise.
- Financial Resources: The PEI can provide the company with financial resources
that the company does not have. This can be money, but it can also be financial
engineering skills, such as the ability to structure a deal or to raise debt, or
establishing credit worthiness.

Financial needs vary across the life cycle of a company.

* Development - to sustain R&D
* Start-up - fixed assets and working capital
* Early growth - sustain sales
* Expansion - new fixed assets abd working capital
* Mature age - acquisitions and business transformation
* Decline - exit the crisis

Each stage has different sources of financing.

* Development - family and friends, business angels, venture capital
* Start-up - family and friends, business angels, venture capital
* Early growth - venture capital, private equity, banking system
* Expansion - banking system, private equity, trade credit
* Mature age - stock exchange, ipo, private equity, banking system
* Decline - family and friends, founder, family and friends



### Private Equity Clusters

Venture Capital

* Development - seed financing
* Start-up - start-up
* Early growth - early growth financing

This cluster is a subset of private equity.

Expansion financing
Replacement Financing
Vulture Financing

6 different deals, markets, different risk/reward profiles

How much ownership, how much hands on?

## Seed, Start-Up, Early Stage Financing

Venture capital

Seed financing - most complex and risky

* Financing of an R&D project to generate a patent that can become a product
* Sectors - biomedical, chemical, IT, pharma
* Very high risk

100/10/1 rules - screen 100 projects, invest in 10, 1 will be a success

Startup financing

* Financing of a company that has a product and a business model
* Money needed to start the activity
* High risk - making a bet on the business plan
* Investor must negotiate the terms to protect the investment, e.g. a put option to sell shares back to the entrepreneur

Early Stage

* The day after financing
* May need to finance a gap in financing based up the uptake of the business
* Investor may need to be hands on -  help the entrepreneur write the business plan again, to analyze the reason of this gap, and to launch the activity of the company again


 ## Expansion Financing

 Expansion financing is the process of financing the growth of the company.

 Growth

 * Can be organic or inorganic
    * Organic/Internal Growth - the company grows by itself
        * Invest in new assets
        * Enhance the working capital
    * Inorganic/External Growth - the company grows by acquiring other companies
        * Enter new markets
        * Change business area

Job of PE Investor

* Organic - give money to the company
* Inorganic - give money, but also act as advisor and consultant to the company

Steps of M&A

* Screen and scout the market
* Support negotiation with the potential target
* Give money to the company to fund the acquisition
    * Give money in exchange for shares
    * PEI creates a special purpose vehicle SPV, PEI and company fund the shell, SPV uses the banking system to fund the acquisition
* Provide legal and taxation support


SPV option avoids saddling the new company with debt

## Replacement Financing

Financing of a mature company that needs to change its capital structure

Three different deals

* Leveraged Buyout (LBO)
    * Identify potential target to buy 100%
    * PEI creates an SPV
    * Fund the SPV with equity and debt
    * SPV buys the target, SPV owns the company, and since the PEI owns the SPV, the PEI owns the company
    * PEI can then easily seel the company as they own it 100%
* PIPE - Private investment in public equity
    * Buy a minority stake in a public company
    * Gamble is the stake is enough to decide who will be the owner of the company
    * Use the stake to negotiate the price
* Corporate Governance Deals
    * This is prompted by a company needing to reorganize its corporate governance, for example succession in a family business
    * PEI buys shares from an existing shareholder to become an insider in the company
    * PEI works as an insider to restructure the governance of the company
    * PEI sells the shares to another shareholder


## Vulture Financing

Finance a company in crisis or decline

Two different deals

* Restructuring Financing
    * Company in crisis but still alive
    * Needs financing to pay suppliers, invest to relaunch
    * Needs strategic support
    * PEI provides money and strategic support
    * Very risky, PEI will want to be the majority shareholder

* Distressed Financing
    * Financing of a defaulted company, dead company
    * PEI buys the assets of the defauled company - brand name, patents, equipment, etc
        * PEI may create a new company, and will use the assets to start a new business
        * PEI may sell the assets to another company
    * Difficult as the sale is negotiated by the court
    

# Week 2 DIscovering Private Equity Investors: Legal Issues and Taxation

## PEI The Map to Investigate

Two formats regulating PEI

* European Union format
    * Also used in Brazil, Turkey, and Russia
    * Private equity is viewed as a financial service
    * Two directives: banking directive and financial services directive
    * Managed for stability: approvals at both local and central level
    * Three players: banks, investment firms, closed-end funds

* Anglo-saxon Format (US and UK)
    * ALso Australia, Commonwealth, and India
    * Private equity is viewed as an entrepreneurial activity
    * Framework: common law + ad hoc fiscal rules + special regulations for PE
    * No supervisor

## Closed-End Funds in Europe: Overview

Europe - 3 types of investors (Banks, Investment Firms, Closed-End Funds)

3 players - closed end

1. Asset management company AMC
    * Financial institution approved and supervised by local supervisors, which is responsible for the management of the fund
    * Must provide at least 2% of the investment in the fund
2. The Funds
    * A fund is a bank account in which the investors can put their money
    * Automatically lose tailored used of the money once they put money in
    * Receives a certificate of participation representing their investment
    * Closed-end - can only invest at the beginning of the fund, and can only withdraw at the end
    * Can only invest the money put in, cannot raise additional money (e.g. no debt)
3. The Investors
    * HIgh net worth individuals, institutional investors, states, and companies


## Closed-End Funds in Europe: Lifetime of a Fund

Document called the Internal Code of Activity is the set of rules that regulate the functioning of the closed-end fund

* One and half years max before time zero is a period of fundraising - proposal, convince investors, etc
* Ang size of fund is 100 - 300 million euros
* Minimum investment is typically 1 million euros
* Money doesn't have to be provided all at once
* Asset company has the possibility to ask for commitment over a 3 year draw down
* Typically fund lives for 10 years, but year 10 can ask for an additional 3 years more to exit from the investment
* Must close the activity after 13 years
* Money then distributed proportionally to the investors

## Management Fees and Carried Interest

Profit mechanisms

* Investors - receive money at the end of the fund
* Code of activity specifies how to calculate the profit for both the investors and the asset management company
* AMC - two types of profit
    * Management fees - fixed percentage taken from the money put in by the investors at the beginning of the fund. For example, 2% of the money put in by the investors is taken by the AMC as the management fee every year.
    * Carried interest - calculated at the end of the life of the fund. The carried interest is a fixed percentage calcualted as the difference between the final IRR and the hurdle rate agreed to upfront. If the carried interest is 30 % (standard is between 20 and 30 percent), and the hurdle rate is 8 % (7-8 is standard), then the AMC will take 30 % of the difference between the final IRR and 8 %.

## Investment Firms and Banks in Europe

Uncommon that banks invest directly in private equity.

* High requirements for regulatory capital which puts a drag on the available profile
* Lots of complicated regulatory restrictions
* More likely to participate as an AMC



Investment firms are more likely to invest in private equity.

* Can do what a bank does except collect deposits
* Liablity is the equity of the shareholders and debts
* Assets are cash collected through debts and equity
* A Shareholders - manage the investment firm, act like the AMC
* B Shareholders - provide the money to the investment firm as investor, do not manage the fund


Remumeration

 * A shareholders - management fees every year, carried interest every year
 * B shareholders - receive money at the end of the fund, receive the profit minus the carried interest given the A shareholders


 Advantages of the investment firm

 * Levverage is possible
 * Direct management of captital with fewer regulations

 ## Limited Partnerships - US

 5 PEI Vehicles

 * Venture capital fund VCF

* Taxation
    * General Partners - taxed as individuals
    * Limited Partners - taxed as individuals
    * The LP vehicle does not pay taxes
    * Tax transparency assumes LP only invests in private equity and the maturtiy of the fund is 10 years

Limited Partnership Agreement LPA

* Contract between the GP and LPs that lays out the rules of the fund
    * The LPA specifies the management fees and carried interest
    * The LPA specifies the rules for the distribution of the profit at the end of the fund
    * The LPA specifies the rules for the exit of the LPs from the fund

General partners typically form a limited liability company LLC to manage the fund,
for example to collect debt, etc

* This allows the use of leverage
