# David Bilger - Trumpet Fundamentals

Notes from the Fundamentals course on "Play With a Pro" - David Bilger

## Introduction

Foundational elements of trumpet playing

* Sound
* Articulation
* Power
* Range
* Agility
* Non-technical (transposition, lyracism, rhythm, etc)

Means to an end of being a great musician who expresses musical ideas using the trumpet

## Sound

Good sound has...

* Warmth
* Richness
* Brilliance

To work on sound...

* Mouthpiece buzzing
  * Consistent buzz
  * Bends, half steps, fourths
* Transition the buzz to the trumpet
  * Same exercises, mid register

Developing sound

* Bends starting 3rd space C, progress up the partials as you develop strength, e.g. E, G
* This develops controlled aperture, cornets, focus in the embrochure

Flow studies

* Conconi, Chicowitz, Borgdoni, Melodies from the back of the Arban book
* Play relaxed and sonorous
* To work on projection, play them fuller than you'd typically play them, wide and broad sound

To summarize, buzzing to work on warmth, bends on higher partials to work on the embrochre/aperture/corners, flow studies to work on projection, consistency of error

## Articulation

Basis of articulation - single tonguing

* start in middle register, strive for clear start to note
* Flutter tongue drill - alternate flutter tongue, single tongue
  * whole notes, half notes, quarter, eigth

* Then move onto single tongue - look for front of note to have clear start, not explosion
* Articulation from a place of stability

Multiple tonguing

* Practice K tonguing, then alternate with T
* Start slowly, don't over articulate, strive for clarity
