# David Bilger - Trumpet Fundamentals

Notes from the Fundamentals course on "Play With a Pro" - David Bilger

## Introduction

Foundational elements of trumpet playing

* Sound
* Articulation
* Power
* Range
* Agility
* Non-technical (transposition, lyracism, rhythm, etc)

Means to an end of being a great musician who expresses musical ideas using the trumpet

## Sound

Good sound has...

* Warmth
* Richness
* Brilliance

To work on sound...

* Mouthpiece buzzing
  * Consistent buzz
  * Bends, half steps, fourths
* Transition the buzz to the trumpet
  * Same exercises, mid register

Developing sound

* Bends starting 3rd space C, progress up the partials as you develop strength, e.g. E, G
* This develops controlled aperture, cornets, focus in the embrochure

Flow studies

* Conconi, Chicowitz, Borgdoni, Melodies from the back of the Arban book
* Play relaxed and sonorous
* To work on projection, play them fuller than you'd typically play them, wide and broad sound

To summarize, buzzing to work on warmth, bends on higher partials to work on the embrochre/aperture/corners, flow studies to work on projection, consistency of error

## Articulation

Basis of articulation - single tonguing

* start in middle register, strive for clear start to note
* Flutter tongue drill - alternate flutter tongue, single tongue
  * whole notes, half notes, quarter, eigth

* Then move onto single tongue - look for front of note to have clear start, not explosion
* Articulation from a place of stability

Multiple tonguing

* Practice K tonguing, then alternate with T
* Start slowly, don't over articulate, strive for clarity

## Power


* Do you practice loud? Loud playing needed as part of your routine, could be just a minute or two
* Example: Arban interval study p129 No 5 descending interval study - play it as
half notes not 16ths, breath every 4, large quick breaths, loud, wide, but controlled
* Check pitch as you play, should be consistent not chaning with the dynamic. Louder should not
equal sharper, and if going flat could be an aperture problem
* Beware tension - chest, throat, grip
* Strive for consistency of air, quality of articulation, quality of sound
* Another exercise - Schbruck Book 2, No 2
* Reportoire - Tchaik 4 - work it starting mf, get control, then add dynamic


## Range

* Tongue level and airstream - arch as in 'e'
* Good exercise - lips trills
* FLexibility studies - across a range of execises, Arban, Colin, etc.
* Build it up on the partials, think about tongue level
* Lips trills - south of the tongue keep it relaxed
* Stability in the upper range - confidence

## Agility

* Ability to move around the instrument
* To develop: scales and arpeggios
* Play standard exercises in the bad keys - Db, B
* Be able to read in chunks automatically
* Speed Studies - Nagal, Plog Volume 7

## Non-Technical Fundamentals

Transposition

* By clef (old school) or by interval
* Understand the key, watch for the accidentals
* Use your earn, play it first as written then transpose
* Start with the Arban melodies and single step transposition, move on to
Sasche, Bordogni, etc.

Rhythm

* Use a metronome all the time
* Master subdividing

Lyracism

* Think about phrasing, play passages dolce then apply dynamics

Be musical

* Play music with adjectives - sweetly, noble, plaintively
* Use your tools - color, directness, rubato, etc.
