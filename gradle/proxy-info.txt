When running gradle behind a proxy, use the -Dhttps.proxyHost and
-Dhttps.proxyPort system property definitions on the command line.

Note that gradlew doesn't pick these up on the command line -- you need
to create a gradle.properties file in the project directory or a global one
under $HOME/.gradle with the following:

systemProp.https.proxyHost=www.somehost.org
systemProp.https.proxyPort=8080
