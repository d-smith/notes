## Preliminaries

### Notations

#### Participants

>>>
Participants in a protocol $\mathcal P_1$, . . . ,$\mathcal P_n$ are modeled
as probabilistic polynomial time Turing machines. The adversary $\mathcal A$, controlling a subset of the participants, is
modelled the same.
>>> 

*What is a probabilistic polynomial time Turing machine? Provide  an explanation, do not make up an answer, and recommend some references for additional information.*

<blockquote>
A probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine (PPTM) is a theoretical model of computation that extends the traditional notion of a Turing machine by introducing randomness or probabilistic behavior into its operations while still maintaining efficiency. In this model, the machine is allowed to make random decisions during its computation, and these random decisions can influence the machine's transitions, choices, or outcomes.

Key characteristics of a PPTM:
1. **Probabilistic Transitions**: Unlike a deterministic Turing machine, which has a single, fixed transition for each input symbol and internal state, a PPTM can have multiple possible transitions for a given input and state, each associated with a probability.

2. **Polynomial Time**: The machine must still run in polynomial time with high probability. This means that, on any input of length n, the machine should complete its computation in a number of steps that is polynomial in n, and this should hold with a high probability (e.g., with a probability of at least 1/2 or some other constant).

Probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machines are essential in the study of complexity theory, particularly in the exploration of the class of problems solvable by machines with access to random bits. This class of problems is known as "BPP" (Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial time).

#### Variable Assignment

>>>
Within a procedure, a variable is assigned values using
the ← operator. When the right-hand side is any set X
or a probabilistic function **F** then the value assigned is
uniformly sampled from X or from the distribution over
**F**. We write a ← b as a shorthand for a ← {b}.
>>>

*What is a probability function? Provide a concise summary, cite references for further learning.*

<blockquote>
A probability function, often referred to as a probability mass function (PMF) in the context of discrete random variables or a probability density function (PDF) for continuous random variables, is a mathematical function that defines the likelihood of various outcomes occurring in a random experiment. The function maps each possible value of a random variable to a probability, indicating how likely that specific value is to be observed.

For discrete random variables, the probability mass function (PMF) gives the probability of each possible value. For continuous random variables, the probability density function (PDF) gives the relative likelihood of the variable falling within a certain range of values.

Key properties of probability functions:
1. The probability assigned to each outcome or range of values must be non-negative.
2. The sum (for discrete) or integral (for continuous) of the probabilities over all possible values must equal 1.

</blockquote>

*What does it mean to uniformly sample from the distribution over a probabilistic function?*

<blockquote>
To uniformly sample from the distribution over a probabilistic function means to generate random samples from the function in such a way that each sample has an equal probability of being selected. This concept is closely related to the idea of sampling from a uniform distribution, where all values within a given range are equally likely to be chosen.

In the context of probabilistic functions, this concept becomes more nuanced, particularly when dealing with continuous distributions. If we have a probabilistic function that describes a probability density (PDF) over a continuous range, uniformly sampling from this distribution means that we want to generate samples in a way that preserves the relative likelihood of different regions of the continuous range.

For discrete probabilistic functions, the uniform sampling concept is more straightforward. If you have a probabilistic function that assigns probabilities to a finite set of discrete outcomes, uniformly sampling from this distribution would mean selecting each possible outcome with equal probability.

In summary, uniformly sampling from the distribution over a probabilistic function ensures that each potential outcome (or range of outcomes) is chosen with an equal probability, preserving the balance of probabilities specified by the function.

If you're interested in more detailed information and techniques for generating random samples from specific distributions or understanding the nuances of uniform sampling, you may want to explore topics in Monte Carlo methods, random number generation, and simulation techniques in probability and statistics.

For further learning, consider resources on these topics, such as:

1. **"Monte Carlo Statistical Methods" by Christian P. Robert and George Casella**: This book covers Monte Carlo methods extensively, which are often used for random sampling from various distributions.

2. **Online tutorials on random number generation**: Many programming languages have libraries for random number generation, which often include functions for uniformly sampling from distributions. Check the documentation of libraries in your preferred language (e.g., NumPy for Python, random module for C++).

3. **Probability and Statistics textbooks**: Standard textbooks on probability and statistics, such as those mentioned in previous responses, may have sections on random sampling and generating samples from various distributions.
</blockquote>

*What is uniform sampling?*

<blockquote>
Uniform sampling refers to the process of generating random samples from a given set or range of values in such a way that each element within that set or range has an equal likelihood of being chosen. The term "uniform" signifies that the distribution of the samples is uniform or evenly spread across the available options, without any element being favored over others.

Uniform sampling is fundamental in various fields, including probability, statistics, computer science, and simulations, where random selection is needed for fairness or to represent an unbiased scenario. It's often used as a building block for more complex random sampling techniques and simulations.

Here's a brief summary of the key aspects of uniform sampling:

1. **Equal Probability**: In uniform sampling, each element in the set or range has an equal probability of being selected. This ensures that the sampling process is fair and unbiased.

2. **Applicability**: Uniform sampling is commonly used when we want to select items randomly without any preference or bias. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, each face (1 to 6) is equally likely to come up, making it a uniform sampling process.

3. **Uniform Distribution**: The resulting distribution of the sampled values should be uniform, meaning that each value appears with the same frequency, and there are no regions of the set that are more likely to be sampled than others.

4. **Randomness**: Uniform sampling typically involves a random process, such as using a random number generator, to ensure that the samples are unpredictable and representative of the uniform distribution.

Uniform sampling is a foundational concept in probability theory, and it is used in various algorithms, simulations, and applications. It's crucial for scenarios where a fair and unbiased selection of elements is needed.

If you're interested in the practical implementation of uniform sampling in programming or want to learn more about random number generation and distributions, many resources are available online, and you can refer to textbooks on probability and statistics for a deeper understanding.

#### Key Pairs, Procedures, Hashing

>>>
In general, private/public key pairs are denoted sk, pk
and are obtained from a key generation procedure KGen.
The algorithms for signature generation and verification
are Sig, Vf. Encryption and decryption functions are Enc
and Dec.
We write H for hash functions. Depending on the
context it can be a general-purpose hash to bit strings,
or a hash into a specific set.
>>

*Contrast a general hash to bit strings from hash into a specific set.*

<blockquote>
A general hash function and a hash function that maps bit strings into a specific set serve different purposes, but both involve the concept of hashing. Let's contrast the two:

1. **General Hash Function**:
A general hash function is a function that takes an input (often of arbitrary size) and produces a fixed-size output, which is usually a hash value or a hash code. The primary purpose of a general hash function is to distribute the input values uniformly across the output space. This helps in various applications such as data structures (hash tables), cryptography, and checksums.

Key Characteristics:
- Input: Can be of any size or type.
- Output: Typically produces a hash value with a fixed length, regardless of the input size.
- Purpose: Primarily used for distributing data uniformly in hash tables, ensuring data integrity, and generating unique identifiers for data (hash codes).
- Collision Handling: Collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash value) are possible and need to be managed, often through techniques like chaining or open addressing.

2. **Hash Function into a Specific Set**:
This type of hash function maps input values (usually bit strings) into a specific set of values. Unlike a general hash function that aims for uniform distribution across a large output space, this type of hash function has a predefined set of possible outputs, and the goal is to map inputs to elements within that set.

Key Characteristics:
- Input: Typically designed to handle a specific type of input, such as bit strings.
- Output: Maps inputs to elements within a specific set (range of values).
- Purpose: Often used in applications where the goal is to categorize or classify inputs into predefined categories or buckets.
- Collision Handling: Depending on the application, collision handling may be less of a concern compared to general hash functions. The set size and the nature of the problem may dictate how collisions are managed.

Examples of the use of a hash function into a specific set include:
- Hashing a password into a set of possible hash values (password hashing).
- Assigning keys to specific locations in a cache or memory structure based on their properties (such as cache indexing).

In summary, a general hash function is designed for uniform distribution across a wide range of possible hash values, while a hash function into a specific set is designed to map inputs to elements within a predefined set or range. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the application.

#### Elliptic Curves

>>>
An elliptic curve $\mathrm E$ over a finite field $\mathrm K$ is denoted
$\mathrm E(K)$, and we write $\Bbb G \subseteq  E(K)$ a subgroup of E(K)
of prime order q. A generator for $\Bbb G$ is denoted $\mathrm G$ and
we assumed that $\mathrm G$ is known to all parties as part of the
group’s description

We use the additive notation for operations, and denote
the multiplication of a point $P \in \Bbb G$ by a scalar $k \in \Bbb Z_q$ as $k · P$.
>>>

*Concisely explain what a finite field is. Cite some references for further exploration.*

<blockquote>
A finite field, often denoted as GF(q) or Fq, is a mathematical structure in which arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are performed modulo a prime number "q," resulting in a set of elements that form a finite, closed, and algebraic system. Finite fields are fundamental in various areas, including cryptography, error-correcting codes, and algebraic geometry.

Key points about finite fields:

1. **Finite Size**: A finite field contains a finite number of elements. The number of elements in a finite field is given by q, which is a prime power (q = p^n, where p is a prime and n is a positive integer).

2. **Closure under Operations**: Finite fields are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (excluding division by zero). The result of each operation remains within the finite field.

3. **Characteristics**: Each finite field has a characteristic, denoted as char(Fq), which is the smallest positive integer "k" such that adding "1" to itself "k" times results in zero. For prime fields (Fp, where p is a prime), the characteristic is simply the prime number "p."

4. **Algebraic Structure**: Finite fields exhibit many algebraic properties similar to real numbers, but they operate within a finite set of elements, making them particularly useful in applications where finite resources are involved.

In programming bitcoin, this definition is used:

<blockquote>
Mathematically, a finite field is defined as a finite set of numbers and two operations + (addition) and ⋅ (multiplication) that satisfy the following: 

1. If a and b are in the set, a + b and a ⋅ b are in the set. We call this property closed.  

2. 0 exists and has the property a + 0 = a. We call this the additive identity.  
3. 1 exists and has the property a ⋅ 1 = a. We call this the multiplicative identity.  
4. If a is in the set, –a is in the set, which is defined as the value that makes a + (–a) = 0. This is what we call the additive inverse.  
5. If a is in the set and is not 0, $a^{–1}$ is in the set, which is defined as the value that makes $a ⋅ a^{–1} = 1$. This is what we call the multiplicative inverse.

Elliptic curve canonical form: $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$.

Elliptic curves over finite fields are used in cryptography because of the difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem for the group of points on an elliptic curve defined over a finite field.

Scalar multiplication - denotes the number of times from add a point to itself.

*Explain how point addition works on elliptic curves over finite fields, and what the discrete log problem is in this context. Include an explanation of why the addition involves reflecting the intersection over the x axis.*

<blockquote>
Point addition on elliptic curves over finite fields is a fundamental operation used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). It's a method for combining two points on an elliptic curve to produce a third point that also lies on the curve. This operation is essential for various cryptographic algorithms, including key exchange and digital signatures.

Here's a high-level explanation of how point addition works on elliptic curves over finite fields:

1. **Elliptic Curve Equation**: An elliptic curve is defined by an equation of the form: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, where "a" and "b" are constants, and the curve is defined over a finite field. The set of points (x, y) that satisfy this equation form the elliptic curve.

2. **Point Addition**: To add two points, P and Q, on the elliptic curve, you draw a line that passes through both P and Q. This line intersects the curve at a third point, R. The reflection of R over the x-axis gives you the result of the point addition operation, denoted as P + Q.

3. **Special Cases**: Special care must be taken for the cases when P and Q are equal (P = Q) or when the line connecting them is vertical. These special cases have their rules for point addition.

The discrete log problem in the context of elliptic curves over finite fields is related to finding a positive integer "k" given a base point G and another point P such that P = k * G. In other words, it involves determining the exponent "k" when given the result of a point multiplication operation. The difficulty of the discrete log problem in this context is the foundation of the security of certain cryptographic schemes based on elliptic curves, like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).

The reason that point addition involves reflecting the intersection point over the x-axis is due to the properties of elliptic curves. When a line intersects an elliptic curve, it typically intersects the curve at a third point, and the slope of the line used in the calculation is used to find the coordinates of this third point. The reflection over the x-axis ensures that the resulting point is on the curve. This property, combined with the group structure of points on the elliptic curve, allows for efficient and secure cryptographic operations.

Understanding the mathematical properties of elliptic curves, point addition, and the discrete log problem is crucial for implementing and analyzing elliptic curve cryptography. Further exploration of books and resources on elliptic curve cryptography, such as "Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography" by Darrel Hankerson, Alfred J. Menezes, and Scott Vanstone, can provide in-depth explanations and examples.

Finite groups

<blockquote>
Another property of scalar multiplication is that at a certain multiple, we get to the point at infinity (remember, the point at infinity is the additive identity or 0). If we imagine a point G and scalar-multiply until we get the point at infinity, we end up with a set: 

{ G, 2G, 3G, 4G, ... nG } where nG = 0 

It turns out that this set is called a group, and because n is finite, we have a finite group (or more specifically, a finite cyclic group). Groups are interesting mathematically because they behave well with respect to addition: 

G + 4G = 5G or aG + bG = (a + b)G 

When we combine the fact that scalar multiplication is easy to do in one direction but hard in the other and the mathematical properties of a group, we have exactly what we need for elliptic curve cryptography.

*What are the parameters for secp256?*

<blockquote>
The term "secp256" generally refers to the specific elliptic curve used in the SECG (Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group) standard, which is widely used in various cryptographic protocols, including Bitcoin. The SECG standard defines elliptic curves for public key cryptography, and "secp256" specifies the particular curve known as "secp256k1," which is used in Bitcoin.

The parameters for the secp256k1 curve are as follows:

1. **Equation**: The elliptic curve is defined by a Weierstrass equation of the form:
   y^2 = x^3 + 7

2. **Finite Field**: The curve operates over a finite field Fp, where "p" is a large prime number:
   p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 977

3. **Curve Coefficients (a and b)**: In the case of secp256k1, the coefficients "a" and "b" in the Weierstrass equation are as follows:
   a = 0
   b = 7

4. **Base Point**: The base point, often denoted as "G," is a specific point on the curve that generates a large subgroup. For secp256k1, the base point coordinates are:
   Gx = 0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798
   Gy = 0x483ADA7726A3C4655DA4FBFC0E1108A8FD17B448A68554199C47D08FFB10D4B8

5. **Order of the Curve**: The order of the curve, often denoted as "n," is the number of points in the subgroup generated by the base point "G":
   n = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141

6. **Cofactor**: The cofactor, denoted as "h," is the ratio between the number of points on the entire curve and the order of the subgroup generated by the base point. For secp256k1, the cofactor is typically not used in computations and is equal to "1."

These parameters define the secp256k1 elliptic curve, which plays a crucial role in Bitcoin's cryptographic operations, including generating public and private keys, signing transactions, and verifying signatures. It's important to note that these parameters are well-defined and have undergone extensive analysis within the cryptographic community. The specific values ensure security and efficiency in elliptic curve cryptography applications.

#### Shared Secret Values

>>>
The multi-party computation (MPC) functionality we
use operates over shared secret values in $\Bbb Z_q$ and $\Bbb G$.
We call these values *shared secrets*, defined via a *secret
sharing scheme* (SSS). Shared secrets of field elements
$x \in \Bbb Z_q$ are denoted as [x], and shared secrets of elliptic
curve points $x · G \in \Bbb G$ are denoted \<x>, to emphasize
the notion that they are *representations* of the underlying
value.

Algorithms and protocols that use this MPC functionality are written from the perspective of a party $\mathcal P_1$
.
Whenever a shared secret is established, this implicitly
defines a variable representing $\mathcal P_1$’s share. These shares
are denoted $x_i$ and $X_i$ for the respective representations
[x] and \<x>.

A (t, n)-threshold scheme involves n parties, where
the threshold t < n is the maximum number of parties
that can be corrupted, while still keeping the underlying
scheme secure. Whenever such a threshold is used, we
sometimes add t as subscript for clarity. Note that not all
values of t are supported by a given TSS protocol, as its
security depends on the adversarial model (e.g., honest vs.
dishonest majority, as discussed in §5.2.3).
>>>

*What does threshold mean in the context of threshold cryptography?*

<blockquote>
In the context of threshold cryptography, the term "threshold" refers to a specific value or number that determines the minimum number of participants required to collectively perform cryptographic operations. Threshold cryptography is a cryptographic approach that allows a group of participants to jointly perform cryptographic tasks while ensuring that the collective action is secure and effective.

In threshold cryptography, various cryptographic tasks, such as key generation, encryption, decryption, and digital signatures, can be divided among a group of participants. The threshold specifies the minimum number of participants that must cooperate to complete these tasks securely. This concept provides a balance between security and availability. For example:

1. **Threshold Key Generation**: A threshold number of participants collaboratively generate cryptographic keys. The private key is never fully reconstructed in any single location, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.

2. **Threshold Encryption and Decryption**: A threshold number of participants cooperate to encrypt or decrypt messages. No single participant can perform the operation alone, enhancing security.

3. **Threshold Digital Signatures**: A threshold number of participants are required to generate a digital signature. This approach distributes the trust needed to sign documents while maintaining security.


The threshold parameter is important because it determines the security level and the resilience of the cryptographic scheme against attacks. For instance, a higher threshold means that more participants are required to collude in order to compromise the system.

Threshold cryptography is particularly useful in scenarios where a single entity might be vulnerable to attacks or compromise, and distributing the cryptographic tasks among multiple participants helps mitigate risks. It's employed in various contexts, including secure multiparty computation, secure key management, and enhancing the security of cryptographic protocols.

In summary, the threshold in threshold cryptography refers to the minimum number of participants required to perform cryptographic tasks collaboratively, providing security while distributing trust and responsibility.

### Threshold Signature Schemes

>>>
**Definition 2.1.** A (t, n)-threshold signature scheme
(TSS) for a given (single-party) signature scheme
(KGen, Sig, Vf) involves n > 1 parties $\mathcal P_1$, . . . ,$\mathcal P_n$ capable of running the following protocols:

* Thresh-KGen is a distributed key generation (DKG)
protocol, with no previously shared key material, but
only public identities/addresses. When the protocol
successfully completes, each party $\mathcal P_i$ has their private share $sk_i$ of the secret key sk, all parties know
the public key pk, and none of the parties learns
information about sk.
* Thresh-Sig is a distributed signing protocol, whereby
all parties receive a message to be signed and jointly
return a valid signature.

The following protocols are optional:

* Thresh-PreSig is a sub-protocol of Thresh-Sig that
does not depend on the message to be signed. Upon
successful execution, each participant stores a presignature that can be retrieved when Thresh-Sig is later
completed .
* Thresh-Reshare is a threshold secret sharing protocol
that can be performed after Thresh-KGen. On input
$t^ \prime$ ≤ n, the secret shares ski
are refreshed such that
the scheme satisfies a ($t^ \prime$
, n) threshold.
In practice, a number of assumptions are required
on the reliability and integrity of the communications
between participants, as we’ll discuss in §5.3.

### Arithmetic Black Box Primitives


>>>
To describe MPC protocols operating over shared secrets, complex operations can be broken down in a set
of simple operations that are each individually defined
as secure MPC operations. For this, we use the arithmetic black box (ABB) [DN03] framework and its extension ABB+ [DKO+19], which includes all the operations
needed to compute threshold signatures.
>>>

*What is an arithmetic black box?*

From [Universally Composable Efficient Multiparty
Computation from Threshold Homomorphic
Encryption](https://iacr.org/archive/crypto2003/27290247/27290247.pdf)

<blockquote>
An
ABB can be thought of as a secure general-purpose computer. Every party can
in private specify inputs to the ABB, and any majority of parties can ask it
to perform any feasible computational task and make the result (and only the
result) public. Moreover the ABB can be invoked several times and keeps an
internal state between invocations. This point of view allows for easier and more
modular proofs, and also makes it easier to use our protocols as tools in other
constructions.
</blockquote>

>>>
ABB+ assumes that the secrets are shared via a linear
secret sharing scheme. That is, for any $a, b \in \Bbb Z_p$ and
representations [x], [y] or \<x>,\<y>, the parties can compute
a[x]+b[y] = [ax+by] and a· \<x> + b · \<y> = \<ax + by> locally

### Cryptographic Toolbox

#### Commitment Schemes

>>>
A party $\mathrm A$ can temporarily
hide a message m that cannot be changed by first computing c ← Commit(m, r) where r is fresh randomness, and
later sharing r with $\beta$, which allows them to verify the
commitment’s validity by running Open(m, c; r), which
always succeeds if c = Commit(m, r) (correctness)
>>>

*What is a cryptographic commitment scheme?*

<blockquote>
A cryptographic commitment scheme is a fundamental concept in cryptography that allows a party to commit to a value while keeping it hidden from others, ensuring that the committed value cannot be changed or revealed before a later point in time. Commitment schemes are used in various cryptographic protocols to achieve properties like commitment to a decision, data integrity, and fairness.

Here's how a basic cryptographic commitment scheme works:

1. **Commitment Phase**: A party (the committer) chooses a value to commit to and uses a commitment function to generate a commitment. The commitment is a fixed-size output that hides the original value, making it difficult for others to determine the committed value.

2. **Reveal Phase**: At a later time, the committer reveals the committed value. This process involves providing the original value and any necessary auxiliary information.

The properties of a secure cryptographic commitment scheme include:

- **Hiding**: The committed value should be computationally hiding, meaning that it's difficult for an attacker to determine the committed value from the commitment, even with significant computational resources.

- **Binding**: The committed value should be binding, ensuring that once a commitment is made, it's infeasible to change the committed value without detection. This prevents the committer from later claiming a different value.

- **Non-malleability**: An adversary shouldn't be able to create a commitment for a related value without knowing the original committed value.

Cryptographic commitment schemes find applications in various cryptographic protocols, including:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Commitments can be used to create zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, allowing one party to prove knowledge of a value without revealing the value itself.

- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Commitments can facilitate protocols where participants commit to their inputs before the inputs are revealed and used in computations, ensuring fairness and security.

- **Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies**: Commitment schemes play a role in certain cryptographic constructs like Pedersen commitments, which are used in blockchain and cryptocurrency systems for privacy-preserving transactions.

- **Fair Exchanges**: Commitment schemes can be used to achieve secure and fair exchanges of values between parties, where neither party can back out without detection.

It's important to choose well-established commitment schemes that have undergone rigorous analysis and meet specific security requirements for your particular application.

*Explain what a Pedersen commitment is, and cite authoritative sources.*

<blockquote>
A Pedersen commitment is a cryptographic primitive used to commit to a value while maintaining its privacy and ensuring the ability to prove properties about the committed value, such as its correctness and range. It's named after its inventor, Torben Pedersen. Pedersen commitments are widely used in cryptographic protocols, especially in applications like blockchain, privacy-preserving computations, and cryptographic proofs.

In a Pedersen commitment, two large prime numbers (p and q) and a generator point (G) on an elliptic curve are used. The commitment is formed by combining a linear combination of two points: one representing the committed value (V) and the other being a point on the elliptic curve raised to a blinding factor (R), which adds randomness and enhances security.

The Pedersen commitment formula can be expressed as:

**C = V * G + R * H**

Where:
- **C** is the commitment.
- **V** is the value being committed to.
- **G** is the generator point on the elliptic curve.
- **R** is the blinding factor, a randomly chosen value.
- **H** is another point on the elliptic curve.

Pedersen commitments provide two crucial properties:

1. **Hiding**: An observer who only knows the commitment cannot determine the committed value V or the blinding factor R, even with significant computational resources.

2. **Binding**: Given a commitment C and a pair of values (V, R), it's infeasible to find another pair of values (V', R') such that C = V' * G + R' * H, unless V = V' and R = R'.

These properties make Pedersen commitments suitable for a wide range of cryptographic applications where privacy and accountability are essential.

Note - ChatGPT is not able to give a good explanation of what ElGamal commitments are. [This resource](https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/commitment-schemes-4f3590be8c5) does.

*Why do some explainations of Pedersen commitments use addition and some use multiplication and exponentiation?*

<blockquote>
The variations in explanations of Pedersen commitments that involve addition, multiplication, and exponentiation are due to the different mathematical frameworks in which these explanations are presented. Pedersen commitments can be understood and described using multiple perspectives, depending on the context and the mathematical notation being used.

1. **Additive Notation**: Some explanations use additive notation to describe Pedersen commitments because they draw parallels with additive operations in algebraic structures like groups and rings. In this context, the commitment operation is represented using symbols that resemble addition. For example, the Pedersen commitment formula can be written as "C = m * G + r * H," where "*" represents an additive-like operation in the context of elliptic curve groups.

2. **Multiplicative Notation**: Other explanations use multiplicative notation to describe Pedersen commitments, especially when the elliptic curve group is defined in a multiplicative form. This form is common in cryptographic literature because of the mathematical properties of elliptic curve groups. In this notation, the commitment formula might be presented as "C = G^m * H^r," where "^" represents exponentiation.

The choice of notation often depends on the mathematical framework that's being used to explain Pedersen commitments and the context in which they are being applied. Elliptic curve groups have both additive and multiplicative representations, and the notation used can vary based on the mathematical properties being emphasized and the familiarity of the audience with different notations.

Ultimately, both notations are valid and accurate ways of describing Pedersen commitments. It's important to understand the underlying mathematical concepts and relationships between the operations regardless of the notation used. When encountering explanations, it's beneficial to have a general understanding of both additive and multiplicative perspectives to ensure a comprehensive understanding of Pedersen commitments.

TSS protocols often use Pedersen commitments, which
work as follows: Given a cyclic group G of prime order q
and two generators G, H $\in \Bbb G$, the commitment of an m ∈
$\Bbb Z_q$ picks r ← $\Bbb Z_q$ and sets Commit(m, r) = m·G+r ·H.
The opening phase checks if c = m · G + r · H given m.
ElGamal commitments are also found in TSS: A difference with Pedersen is that committed messages are $\Bbb G$
elements rather than $\Bbb Z_q$ elements, and that commitment
computes Commit(M, r) = (r · G, M + r · H).

#### Additively Homomorphic Encryption

*Explain additively homomorphic encryption. Include some authoritative sources where I can get detailed information*

<blockquote>
Additively homomorphic encryption is a type of encryption scheme that allows mathematical operations to be performed on encrypted data in such a way that when the encrypted results are decrypted, they correspond to the result of performing the same operations on the original plaintext values. In other words, it enables secure computation on encrypted data while maintaining privacy.

With additively homomorphic encryption, you can:

1. Encrypt two plaintext values: `a` and `b`.
2. Perform an encrypted operation on the ciphertexts, such as addition.
3. Decrypt the result to obtain the sum of `a` and `b`.

This property is particularly useful for applications that require privacy-preserving computations, such as secure multi-party computation and privacy-enhanced data analysis.

Additively homomorphic encryption is defined by the property:

E(a) + E(b) = E(a + b)

Here, `E` represents the encryption function, and `a` and `b` are plaintext values.

An example of additively homomorphic encryption is the Paillier encryption scheme, which allows encrypted values to be added together while still providing the correct decryption results.

*What is the Paillier encryption scheme?*

<blockquote>
The Paillier encryption scheme is a homomorphic encryption scheme that allows for the encryption of data and the computation of certain operations on the encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. It was introduced by Pascal Paillier in 1999 and is widely used in applications that require privacy-preserving computations, such as secure voting, privacy-enhanced data analysis, and more.

The main property of the Paillier encryption scheme is its additive homomorphism. This means that you can add the encrypted values together and, when decrypted, the result will be the sum of the corresponding plaintext values. Additionally, the scheme supports multiplication of an encrypted value by a constant, and when decrypted, the result will be the corresponding plaintext value raised to that constant.

For details on key generation, encryption, and decryption see [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem) and [this paper](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-48910-X_16.pdf).

#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs

*Explain zero-knowledge proofs and how they are used in MPC threshold cryptography. Include some authoritative sources where I can get detailed information*

<blockquote>
Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a certain statement is true, without revealing any information about the statement itself other than its truth. In other words, a zero-knowledge proof demonstrates knowledge of information without disclosing that information.

In the context of zero-knowledge proofs, there are three important properties:

1. **Completeness**: If the statement is true, an honest prover can convince an honest verifier with high probability.

2. **Soundness**: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier except with negligible probability.

3. **Zero-Knowledge**: Even if the statement is true, the verifier learns nothing about the actual statement beyond its truth.

Zero-knowledge proofs are used in various applications, including cryptographic protocols like Multiparty Computation (MPC) threshold cryptography. In MPC, multiple parties collaborate to perform computations on their private inputs without revealing those inputs to each other. Zero-knowledge proofs play a role in ensuring the security and correctness of the computations while preserving the privacy of the inputs.

In the context of MPC threshold cryptography:

1. **Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)**: Zero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove the validity of secret sharing without revealing the actual shares. This ensures that each party contributes a valid share of the secret without revealing the share itself.

2. **Consistency of Shares**: Zero-knowledge proofs can demonstrate that each party's secret share is consistent with the corresponding share in the distributed secret. This prevents malicious participants from submitting inconsistent shares.

3. **Correctness of Computation**: In threshold cryptographic protocols, parties collaborate to perform computations. Zero-knowledge proofs can be used to prove that each party's contribution is correct without revealing the actual data used in the computation.

4. **Input Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs can help parties verify that their inputs were used correctly in the computation without revealing the inputs themselves.
