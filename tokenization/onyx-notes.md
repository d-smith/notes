# Note from [The Future of Wealth Management](https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/documents/portfolio-management-powered-by-tokenization.pdf)

Themes

* Blockchain tech, tokenization, and smart contracts will enable new ways of managed solutions for building and managing discretionary portfolios.
* Accelerate semi-liqued product structures for alts exposure `with the development of new
capabilities in operational processing, availability of secondary liquidity by tokenizing fund positions on a shared
ledger system, availability of detailed reporting and consolidation of fragmented investor ownership registries
(which will continue to fragment with the emergence of tokenization across new blockchain network registries)`



> Alternative investments (“alts”), such as private equity, private credit, real estate, and infrastructure, can offer
attractive risk-adjusted returns as well as portfolio diversification benefits, generally in exchange for less liquidity.
As a result, some of the world’s most sophisticated institutional investors allocate a significant portion of their
assets to these investments. Demand from individual investors for alternative investments continues to grow, but
adoption lags that of public and traditional investments. Key challenges stem from the less liquid nature of the
underlying assets, limited access and a lack of investor and advisor education.

POC

* Our goal in this project, therefore, was to identify a technology approach that could enable a wealth manager
to easily construct, deploy and automatically manage model portfolios at scale, across traditional and alternative
assets, allowing a seamless investor experience with improved transparency

> The vision for this technology layer is to enable the management of many separately managed accounts at scale,
preserving unique investor-level account customizations and reporting, while enabling the wealth manager to effect
changes to all portfolios by adjusting their reference model portfolios. With the use of blockchain technology, it
may be possible to expand the coordination and transaction of more types of assets across multiple managers on
shared ledgers to accrue even more efficiency and expand the investable universe and potential liquidity.

Wealth Management

* Can classify offerings as advisory or discretionary
* Advisory - client makes final decision
* Discretionary - manager makes final decision

Problem Statements

1. Adjusting portfolio allocations across asset types (both public and private) requires multiple systems,
manual processes and multiparty reconciliation.
2. Alternative investment funds are not commonly included in model portfolios due to operational processing
requirements and limited liquidity
    * Operational processing requirements can be high-touch, non-standard and fragmented.
    * Liquidity is limited given the nature of the underlying investments and the less-mature market infrastructure
technology.
3. Access to and distribution of tokenized assets is fragmented across blockchain networks
