Liquidity - used to exchange one asset of another, pool of assets

* Decentralized exchange - example of liquidity in acction
* Exchanges provide incentives to add assets to the pool

Chasing yield - low risk, high yield is the dream

## Basics

Block chain - public ledger
Transactions in the chain can be code, can have funds

https://etherscan.io/

Can see transaction details, e.g. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9d2f7118114a0b7f89632ce989912c21cac73911d67ae2094930909b3c9a5a1f

See the smart contract assocaited with the transaction, e.g. 

Wallets, Pay for transactions (e.g. to send, to receive is free)

Alternative chains - lower gas fees, many compatible with eth.

* Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Binance - compatible with Ethereum, can have metamask wallets too
* Polygon block chain - quickswap exchange - switch the network to polygon, etc.

* USDC - 1:1 with US dollars
* USDT - tether
* DAI Stable Coin - algorithmically back by ETH and other assets

APR, APY (compounded)

Uniswap - decentralized exchange - https://uniswap.org/

Where's the best yield?

* Where there's a lot of trading, volatility, and volume with low liquidity
* Low risk - stable coin liquidity pairs

## Lending and Borrowing

What you want, work backwards, for example

* By some bitcoin... deposit some dollars to coinbase pro, buy some bitcoin
* Set up a metamask wallet
* How to withdraw bitcoin the ethereum? You can't bitcoin you can only buy, sell, move around
* Wrapped bitcoin - manage them one to one, keep wrapped pegged to bitcoin
* In coinbase, trade bitcoin for wrapped bitcoin
* Send wrapped to your wallet address
* Metamask - view on etherscan.io
* Go to aave.com, connect your wallet
* Go to wrapped bitcoin, deposit your wrapped bitcoin
* You need ethereum to pay for the gas fees
* ETH gas fees super high... use avalance or polygon?

On the avalanche network

* Connect your wallet to avalanche, maybe via trader joe
* Use snowtrace for your etherscan equivalent
* chainlist.org shows EVM compatible blockchains
* Buy avax on coinbase pro, move to your metamask avalance wallet address
* Go to trader joe or pangolin, look at the volume, swap avax to WBTC.e
* If you have wrapped you can use the avax bridge
* May have to go to snowscan to find the wrapped, import as custom token into metamask wallet
* Go to aave to deposit, need avax for gas feed
* After coins deposited you can borrow against it.

Use coinbase pro. Look at Kraken, FTX, crypto.com, Kucoin

## Liquidity

* How you trade one token for another
* Automated market maker (decentralized), Order Book (centralized)

Decentralized exchanges

* Uniswap
* Sushi Swap
* Pancake Swap (binance)
    * BSC - binance smart chain
* Quickswap - for polygon
* Trader Joes
* Spooky Swap
* Spirit swap

Look for wrapped tokens to find popular exchanges

What about yield on a stable coin pair, to avoid market risk

* Spooky swap - USDC, liquidity pair on USDC-DAI
    * daily fees divided by volumes times 365 days a year to see what you in a year per dollar

## Staking

* Incentives for HODLing tokens, often with a timelock

Pancake swap, earn - farms and pools
Binance chain is on pancake swap
Binance.org will show the bridges, bridge lets you bring assets across chains.

Bridge - lock tokens on one network, pair it up on the other, take a small cut
