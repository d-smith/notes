Two places data is stored in Ethereum

* Chain data
* State trie (pronounced tree)

Smart contracts can write to both chain data and state trie, but can only
read from state.

Why write somewhere you can't read (from a contract)?

* Writes to chain - 8 gas/byte
* Writes to trie - 625 gas/byte
* Clients can read from both.
* Writing to chain data is used to model asynchronous event triggers

To write to chain data from solidity code, using the crowdfund example, first
defined a new event:

event NewContribution(address indexed _from, uint256 _value);

indexed keyword - attach to one or more of the fields in the event to allow
attaching listeners to listen for specific values of the event.

To write the event, call it.

For example at the end of the contribute method:

NewContribution(msg.sender, msg.value)
