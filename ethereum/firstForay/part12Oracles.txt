It might be useful to perform certain kinds of computation off-chain
and pull the results into your contract. Or bring any outside data 
into the chain to store with/use with your contracts.

Oracles

The Ethereum blockchain is its own source of truth - it encapsulates its
own state and knows nothing about the outside world.

An Oracle service sites between the chain and the outside world,
and provides a consistent way to relay data from the outside world
onto the chain. This is a concept, there's no single Oracle...

Data from the outside world...

* First call into the chain via a contract
* Contract will know which Oracle service to use, and will
call out using the service.
* Oracle service does the interaction with the real world
* Oracle service calls back into the contract, probably on
a callback function.
