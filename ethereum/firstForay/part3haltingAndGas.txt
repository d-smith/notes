Halting problem: it is impossible to write a function that determines whether or not another
function runs indefinitely or whether that function terminates at another point.

Can write halt(f) bool

 Ethereum virtual machine allows for arbitrary computation of other people's code - how do
 you avoid if you are being DDoS'd running infinite loops

 Each virtual machine opcode has a cost associated with it (gas)
 ==> You pay for the computation you do, which shields the network from DDoS

 The amount of gas per computational step is fixed, the amount of ether you pay for it with is not.

 Exchange rate of gas to ether that is determined by the miners on the network.
