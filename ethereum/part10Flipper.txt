If you define a value in the object when you're making a transaction
to a contract, that value of ether will get passed into the contract
that you can access in the msg.value property.

payable keyword - function must be payable if you want to send ether
to it

deployed.makeWager({from:acct1, value: web3.toWei(5,'ether')})
decypher.etherBalance(deployed.address)

In accept wager we want to only transition state if the accepted amount
matches the wager. If it doesn't, we have to throw to rollback the 
transaction, because returning false if the accepted amout was wrong
would not transition state but would still credit the value to the 
contract.

Randomness - simulating radomness on the blockchain is notoriously 
difficult.
