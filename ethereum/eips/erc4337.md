# ERC 4337 Account Abstraction

Use a smart contract as the basis of a users account, enabled via a system of higher level infrastructure that does not require a modification to the blockchain protocol.

How it works:

* A user's intent is packaged by the app into a psuedo transaction call a UserOperation
* A UserOperation can contain any number of transactions and the data needed to execute the transactions with smart contract accounts
* UserOperations are sent to a network of Bundlers. Bundlers can pull transactions from public mempools or private mempools. Bundlers package the UserOperations and send them to the blockchain.
* On the blockchain, a smart contract called the EntryPoint handles the verification and execution of these transactions by WalletContracts, smart contracts owned by a user.
* Other smart contracts, like paymasters and aggregators, can help sponsor transactions and aggregate signatures for better user experiences.
