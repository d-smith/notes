Auditing

* Review the docs and code
* Check against common mistakes
* Identify issues
* Evaluate security of the process

Formal verification - like a fancy diff between the code and a formal specification.

Software Lifecycle

* Design
* Spec, Code, Test
* Testing
* Spec Checking
* Fuzzing
* Auditing
* Formal Verification => Proof the rules you wrote hold

Iterate

Formal verification myths

* FV can only prove absense of bugs
* Hardest problem is computational
* FV is one time deal

Reality

* Biggest value of FV is finding bugs
* Hardest problem is specification
* FV guarantees code upgrade safety
