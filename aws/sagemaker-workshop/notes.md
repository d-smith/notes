SageMaker

* Build, Train & Tune, Deploy

Can package your stuff for training and inference in your own custom containers

SageMaker has many [built in algoritms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html)

[SageMaker SDK - python](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk)

Datasets - headlines, classify it as business, science and technology, xxx, and xxx

NLP, NLU

Word Embeddings - stanford glove word embeddings

nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove

News headline -> word vector -> one hot encoded output
