Doesn't look like LogGroup or LogStream support the specification of a kms key
used to encrpyt logs.

Encryption is managed at the log group level:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html

You can associated the key with the log group via the CLI:

aws logs associate-kms-key --log-group-name my-log-group --kms-key-id "key-arn"
