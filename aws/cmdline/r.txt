To get install.packages("RPostgreSQL") to install, I first has to add 'username'
to sudoers (under the root user example) so I could run the following in a shell
launched from RStudio web tools console:

yum install postgresql-devel

After that back in R studio I could do...

install.packages('RPostgreSQL')
library(RPostgreSQL)
